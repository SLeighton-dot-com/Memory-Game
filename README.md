* # Description

Memory Balls is a fun and challenging game designed to test and improve your memory skills. The game is simple but can get tricky as you progress. The objective is to remember the sequence in which the balls light up and then replicate that sequence.

* ### How to Play

  * Watch Carefully: At the start of each turn, a sequence of balls will light up. Pay close attention, as you'll need to remember this sequence.<br><br>
  * Repeat the Sequence: After the sequence is shown, click on the balls in the same order they lit up. Be quick, as there's a timer counting down!<br><br>
  * Score Points: For every correct sequence you replicate, you earn a point. The sequences get longer with each turn, so stay sharp!<br><br>
  * Game Over: If you click the wrong ball or run out of time, the game ends. Don't worry; you can always start a new game to beat your high score!

 * ### Tips

    * Stay focused and try to visualize the sequence in your mind.<br><br>
    * As the sequences get longer, try to find patterns or create a story in your head to remember them better.<br><br>
    * Challenge yourself and aim to beat your previous high score!
